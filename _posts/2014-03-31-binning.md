title: Binning Continuous Data
tags: [R]
---

Recently, I had a continuous variable that I wanted to plot and use color to show the gradient. The variable's values were too fine for color to reveal closely spaced data. So I wanted to quantize the variable into defined bands. 

The data's values were outside the (absolute) maximum of the band; I wanted to bucket anything that exceeded the band into the maximum bands. For this purpose, this was fine.

sample = data.frame(x = c(1:20), y = 1, obs = runif(20, -150, 150))
the.breaks = seq(-100, 100, by = 20)

sample$interval = factor(findInterval(sample$obs, vec = the.breaks, all.inside = TRUE), 
    labels = the.breaks, levels = c(1:length(the.breaks)))

pal = rev(brewer.pal(11, "RdBu"))

ggplot(sample, aes(x, y, colour = interval)) + geom_point(size = 10) + scale_colour_manual(values = pal, 
    limits = the.breaks, labels = the.breaks) + guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3, 
    shape = 19)))
