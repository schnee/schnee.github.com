title: Binning Continuous Data
tags: [R]
---

Recently, I had a continuous variable that I wanted to plot and use color to show the gradient. The variable's values were too fine for color to reveal closely spaced data. So I wanted to quantize the variable into defined bands. 

The data's values were outside the (absolute) maximum of the band; I wanted to bucket anything that exceeded the band into the maximum bands. In the future, I'll change the labels of the interval factor to indicate this.

    labels = the.breaks, levels = c(1:length(the.breaks)))

ggplot(sample, aes(x, y, colour = interval)) + geom_point(size = 10) + scale_colour_manual(values = pal, 
    limits = the.breaks, labels = the.breaks) + guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3,
