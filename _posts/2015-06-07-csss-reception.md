![awesome sunset](/figs/2015-06-07-csss-reception/sunset.jpg)

Not to make anyone jealous or anything, but the above is the sunset on the lanai from where I'll be spending the next 30 days.

The reception hosted 60+ students from ALL over the world in many different disciplines: Economics, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering, Biology, &c. I had a great time talking to everyone. Tomorrow, at 9am, class starts.
